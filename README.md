#gallery

##Description
A web-gallery written using the expressjs framework. 

##Configuration
All the images are stored/retrieved via cloudinary. In "app.js", there is a line
(49 for me) that specifies the cloud_name, api_key, and api_secret, which must
correspond to the particular cloudinary account that you are using for your
application, so make sure to fill those in with your own credentials.
